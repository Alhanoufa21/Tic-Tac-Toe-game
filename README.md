# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a Tic-Tac-Toe game using adversarial search algorithms to achieve a particular goal. We will concentrate on the MinMax and Alpha-Beta algorithms and compare the implementation of both algorithms.

## Description
This project involves creating a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

### Features
- **Two-player mode**: Play against another human player.
- **Single-player mode**: Play against the computer using MinMax or Alpha-Beta pruning algorithms.
- **Algorithm comparison**: Compare the performance and decision-making process of the MinMax and Alpha-Beta algorithms.

## Algorithms
### MinMax Algorithm
The MinMax algorithm is a recursive algorithm used to choose an optimal move for a player assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally.

### Alpha-Beta Pruning
Alpha-Beta pruning is an optimization technique for the MinMax algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.
